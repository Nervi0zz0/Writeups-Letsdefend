[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) _(Optional: If you chose MIT License)_

Welcome! This repository serves as the central hub for my hands-on cybersecurity skill development using the [LetsDefend.io](https://letsdefend.io/) platform. It's a chronicle of my learning journey, showcasing practical analysis and response capabilities.

## <ins>Why This Repository Exists</ins>

In cybersecurity, theory is essential, but **practice is paramount**. This repository bridges that gap by documenting my work on realistic simulations. My objectives are:

* To **actively learn and apply** Blue Team / SOC techniques.
* To **build a portfolio** demonstrating practical skills in threat detection, analysis, and incident response.
* To **reinforce my understanding** through detailed documentation (write-ups).
* To **track my progress** and identify areas for future growth.

## <ins>About LetsDefend: The Ultimate Cyber Gym</ins>

LetsDefend isn't just another training site; it's a **high-fidelity Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation environment**. It provides an unparalleled opportunity to step into the shoes of security professionals and tackle real-world scenarios.

> **Key Features & Philosophy:**
> * **Learn by Doing:** Move beyond passive learning with interactive, real-time alert handling.
> * **Realistic Simulations:** Investigate SIEM alerts, analyze malware, perform digital forensics, and respond to incidents just like in a live SOC.
> * **Diverse Learning Paths:** Structured paths for roles like SOC Analyst, Threat Hunter, and Incident Responder.
> * **Continuous Practice:** Regular challenges and simulated alerts keep skills sharp and relevant.

> **My Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê \
> *Absolutely essential for anyone serious about developing practical, job-ready cybersecurity skills.*

## <ins>Repository Content & Structure</ins>

This repository is organized into two main sections:

### üõ°Ô∏è Challenge Write-ups

Detailed walkthroughs and solutions for specific skill-based challenges on the LetsDefend platform.

* **Organization:** `Role / Skill Level / Challenge-Name /`
    * `README.md`: Contains the step-by-step analysis, findings, and methodology.
    * `images/`: Holds relevant screenshots, logs snippets, and evidence files.
* **Roles Covered:** Security Analyst, Incident Responder, Detection Engineer, Cloud Security Engineer, DFIR.
* **Skill Levels:** Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard.

### üö® SOC Alert Analysis

In-depth analysis of simulated alerts encountered within the LetsDefend SOC environment. This section mirrors the process of investigating potential threats based on SIEM triggers.

* **Organization:** `SOC-Alert-Analysis / Severity / Alert-ID_or_Name /`
    * `README.md`: Details the investigation process, analysis, containment/eradication steps (if applicable), and lessons learned.
    * `images/`: Contains screenshots from the investigation (SIEM, endpoint, logs, etc.).
* **Severities:** Critical, High, Medium, Low.

## <ins>Tools & Technologies Utilized</ins>

Throughout these challenges and simulations, I am gaining hands-on experience with various industry-standard tools and concepts, including (but not limited to):

* SIEM Platforms (Concept & Alert Triage)
* Log Analysis (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, Firewall Logs, etc.)
* Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)
* Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR - Concepts & Analysis)
* Basic Malware Analysis
* Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR - Concepts & Tools)
* Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIP - Concepts)
* MITRE ATT&CK Framework
